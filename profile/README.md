effectorHQ (*prev. OpenClawHQ*) is an open studio building the next generation of Proactive AI agent capabilities. Each project aims to solve a real problem, is backed by real research, and is designed to stand on its own. Together they form a coherent vision: **typed, composable, verifiable hands for AI.**

Starting with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Designed for a larger capability layer. We exist because one team can't cover every use case. Distributed, effector-native, community-driven is a better architecture.

We don't build the brain (that's the LLM). We don't build the body (that's the runtime — [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python), and whatever comes next). We build the hands — and we make sure every hand is safer, more composable, and more powerful than what existed before.

### The Effector Type System

Our [analysis of 13,729 ClawHub skills](https://github.com/effectorHQ/clawhub-analysis) found a **67% agent failure rate**: driven by untyped interfaces, missing prerequisites, and permission mismatches.

The core thesis: AI agent capabilities need types. Today you chain two skills and pray they work. Tomorrow you type-check the composition before a single token is spent. 

This is the paradigm we're building: **Effector** = the smallest capability unit an agent can discover, inspect, run, compose, and carry across runtimes.

| Project | What it is | Status |

| [`effector-types`](https://github.com/effectorHQ/effector-types) | **Standard capability types** — the `lib.d.ts` for agent tools, grounded in 13K+ skills | v0.2.0 |
| [`clawhub-analysis`](https://github.com/effectorHQ/clawhub-analysis) | **Empirical data** — 13,729 skills analyzed, type distributions, failure rates | Data + notebook |

### What gets built here

| Effector Type | What it is |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Skill Effectors** | Markdown-defined capabilities (SKILL.md) with typed interfaces |
| **Extension Effectors** | TypeScript plugins that hook into runtime SDKs |
| **Workflow Effectors** | Multi-step pipelines with typed composition |
| **Workspace Effectors** | Agent persona bundles (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md) |
| **Bridge Effectors** | Cross-runtime adapters (OpenClaw ↔ MCP ↔ others) |
| **Quality Effectors** | Lint, eval, audit, and supply-chain tools |

### How we build

| Principle | In practice |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Demo First** | Ship working code before writing proposals. A running prototype beats a perfect spec. |
| **Ship Loud** | Every merge, every release note, every contributor gets signal. Shipping should feel like winning. |
| **Open by Default** | Code, roadmap, decisions, failed experiments — if it can be open, it is. |
