```
Brain  →  Body   →  Hands
LLMs      Runtimes   Effectors
          (OpenClaw,  (typed, composable, verifiable
           Claude,     capability units)
           etc.)
```

effectorHQ builds the capability layer for AI agents. We don't build the brain (that's the LLM). We don't build the body (that's the runtime). We build the hands — and we make sure every hand is typed, composable, and verifiable.

Currently powering the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Our [analysis of 13,729 ClawHub skills](https://github.com/effectorHQ/clawhub-analysis) found a **67% agent failure rate** — driven by untyped interfaces, missing prerequisites, and permission mismatches. That's the problem we're solving.

### What gets built here

| Effector Type | What it is |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Skill Effectors** | Markdown-defined capabilities (SKILL.md) with typed interfaces |
| **Extension Effectors** | TypeScript plugins that hook into runtime SDKs |
| **Workflow Effectors** | Multi-step pipelines with typed composition |
| **Workspace Effectors** | Agent persona bundles (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md) |
| **Bridge Effectors** | Cross-runtime adapters (OpenClaw ↔ MCP ↔ others) |
| **Quality Effectors** | Lint, eval, audit, and supply-chain tools |

### How we build

| Principle | In practice |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Closed loops over open ends** | A working `lint → eval → publish` beats 10 more repos. |
| **Data-grounded** | Every type, every metric, every claim traces back to the [ClawHub corpus](https://github.com/effectorHQ/clawhub-analysis). |
| **Open by Default** | Code, roadmap, decisions, failed experiments — if it can be open, it is. |
